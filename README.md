# Back Up Your SaaS

## Statement of Purpose

This repository provides documentation, tools, and strategies for programmatically backing up cloud-based services and SaaS applications. It serves as a resource for users who believe in the fundamental right to maintain control over their own data through systematic, automated backups.

## Mission

To empower users with the knowledge and tools necessary to implement robust, programmatic backup strategies for their cloud data across multiple service providers.

## Core Principles

### Digital Sovereignty
We believe that the ability to periodically back up your own data is an unalienable right of digital sovereignty. The cloud is not a backupâ€”it's a primary storage location that requires its own backup strategy.

### Programmatic Over Manual
Effective backups must be programmatic. Manual backups are prone to human error, inconsistency, and are not scalable in data-rich environments. This repository focuses exclusively on automated, scriptable backup solutions.

### The 3-2-1 Rule
All backup strategies should adhere to the 3-2-1 rule:
- **3 copies** of your data
- On **2 different media types**
- With **1 copy off-site**

Applied to cloud data: maintain the cloud copy, a local backup, and a backup in a different cloud provider.

## Repository Structure

Services are organized into folders by provider, with data types categorized within each service folder. For each service, documentation includes:

- **Default/built-in backup mechanisms** offered by the provider
- **Third-party backup tools** and services
- **Custom scripts** and automation solutions
- **Community tools** and utilities from GitHub and other sources

## Why Cloud Backups Matter

Despite the misconception that "the cloud is the backup," users regularly lose access to cloud data due to:

- **Vendor lockouts** from policy changes or account issues
- **Rapid pricing changes** forcing migration or data loss
- **Security breaches** including ransomware
- **Service shutdowns** or feature deprecations

## The Current State

Most cloud providers fall short of providing adequate programmatic backup capabilities. While data liberation frameworks like GDPR have pressured vendors to offer rudimentary export mechanisms, these often lack:

- Complete data coverage (missing CDN images, metadata, etc.)
- Programmatic access via APIs
- Incremental backup support
- Comprehensive documentation

## Gold Standard: GitHub

GitHub exemplifies best practices with a robust API that enables users to script custom backup solutions. This accessibility, combined with modern AI tools for scripting assistance, represents the model all cloud providers should follow.

## Contributing

Given the vast number of cloud services in use today, comprehensive coverage is impossible for a single maintainer. **Contributions are warmly welcome** for:

- Documentation of additional services
- Backup scripts and automation tools
- Third-party tool reviews
- Best practices and strategies

Please ensure contributions align with the repository's focus on programmatic, automated backup solutions.

## Service Folders

Service-specific documentation and tools are organized in the following directories:

- `github/` - GitHub repository backups
- `notion/` - Notion workspace backups
- `google-workspace/` - Google Drive, Docs, Gmail, etc.
- `dropbox/` - Dropbox file backups
- `trello/` - Trello board exports
- `hashnode/` - Hashnode blog backups
- `medium/` - Medium article backups
- `twitter/` - Twitter/X data archives
- `linkedin/` - LinkedIn data exports
- `slack/` - Slack workspace backups

Each folder contains service-specific documentation, scripts, and tool references.

## License

Contributions and usage should respect the spirit of digital sovereignty and user empowerment.
